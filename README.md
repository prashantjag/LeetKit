## 📚 About

**LeetKit** is my personal journey to code daily, solve algorithm/data structure problems, track my consistency, and provide C++ solutions for anyone preparing for interviews or wanting to learn. Every day, I upload my solutions to share knowledge and help others!

   git clone https://github.com/prashantjag/LeetKit.git

   ```

2. **Browse the solutions**
   Solutions are organized by problem or date. Find the one you need and open the C++ file.

3. **Run a solution**
   Compile and run any solution using your preferred compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ path/to/solution.cpp -o solution
   ./solution

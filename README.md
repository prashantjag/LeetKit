## 📚 About

**LeetKit** is a personal repository where I solve coding problems daily and upload my solutions. The primary goal is to track my consistency, improve my problem-solving skills, and provide helpful C++ solutions for others preparing for coding interviews or competitive programming.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prashantjag/LeetKit.git
   cd LeetKit
   ```

2. **Browse the solutions**  
   Navigate the folders to find daily problem solutions, usually organized by date or problem topic.

3. **Run a solution**  
   Open the C++ file you want to try, compile, and run it using your preferred compiler (e.g. g++, clang++).

   ```bash
   g++ path/to/solution.cpp -o solution
   ./solution
   ```
